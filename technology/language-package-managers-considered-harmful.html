      <h1>Language Package Managers Considered Harmful</h1><div class="blog-header"><p>Posted on February 15, 2013</p></div><p>Why does every programming language and environment have to provide its own package manager?</p>
<p>Perl has had CPAN for ages. Ruby has rubygems. Python has both easy_install and pip. PHP uses PEAR. Recently, I discovered node.js's npm. And, I decided, enough is enough.</p>
<p>Each Linux distribution comes with a system package manager, generally either RPM-based or DEB-based, each very capable of landing files on disk in pre-defined locations. Both systems have been well tested, are well understood, and really just work. Both systems have integration with the likes of Puppet and Chef. Both systems are capable of defining dependencies across programming languages. Both systems really just work.</p>
<p>Instead of using them, though, each community has felt the need to re-invent the wheel, but only for their language or environment. Want to install a C extension in one of these languages? It's compiled fresh on every install. Missing a required shared library and get a cryptic error message? <a href="http://www.lmgtfy.com">Let me Google that for you</a>, and I hope you are feeling lucky!</p>
<p>So, let's say I use CPAN, and I use PEAR. I dabble in gems, and succumb to npm. What has that gotten me? Now, I can't just look in one place to figure out what's installed on my machine. I can't just grab security updates from the provider of my distribution and sleep well at night. Instead, I get to check in with each package provider, each of which handles updates in its own way. As a matter of fact, each package manager has its own interface, its own capabilities, and its own annoyances. <i>That</i> is a major annoyance.</p>
<p>I also think of the work that has gone into writing yet another dependency resolution engine. The number of times yet another person has grappled with how to handle version mismatches, or circular dependencies, or development versus release version numbers. And then the additional work done by the various distributions to get the code back into rpms or debian packages.</p>
<p>Seriously, use the system package manager. It works.</p>
