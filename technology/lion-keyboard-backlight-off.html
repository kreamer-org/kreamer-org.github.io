      <h1>How to Turn the Keyboard Backlight Off in Lion</h1><div class="blog-header"><p>Posted on April 14, 2012</p></div><p>OS X Lion has bug that turns on the keyboard backlight when doing Fast 
User Switching, and then <em>keeps it on</em> after logging in with a user
that has <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4882">disabled</a> the
feature. Worse yet, the system doesn't seem to "know" that the backlight
is still on. So, you've got to turn it "on" and then back off again to 
actually turn it off, hitting the associated keyboard key twice.  Annoying.
</p>
<p>I found out from a co-worker how to get this to stop, and wanted to post
here to remember and to help anyone else having the problem. In Terminal,
type:
</p><pre>
sudo "/Applications/System Preferences.app/Contents/MacOS/System Preferences"
</pre>
This runs System Preferences as root, rather than your user. Obviously,
you'll need sudo permissions to be able to do this; don't worry, you'll
have the correct permissions if you are an admin on the machine.  Then,
go to the same Keyboard preference pane, and disable <cite>"Automatically
illuminate keyboard in low light"</cite>. Reboot your machine, and you should
no longer get a backlit keyboard at the login prompt.
