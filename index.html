          <h1>On Almost But Not Quite</h1><div class="blog-header"><p>Posted on January 3, 2015</p></div><p><i>Use the right tool for the job.</i></p>
<p>It's such a truism that it hardly warrants discussion. Of course, the best thing
    to do is to use the right tool for the job, because if you don't, you end up wasting
    time. It also seems like an obvious corollary that the more unsuitable the tool,
    the more time is wasted. However, this isn't quite true; you end up wasting the
    most time when dealing with a tool that is just barely not suitable.</p>
<p>Thought experiment time: let's say you have a tree which, for whatever reason, must not be allowed to stand.
    This is a sizeable tree, over twenty feet tall and a couple feet in diameter.
    You glare up at this future dining room table, raise a fist, yell <i>"Buddy, you are coming down!"</i>,
    and ponder the right tool for this job. If you have any experience at all cutting down trees,
    the instant answer is a chainsaw.</p>
<p>Let's say, though, that you don't have any experience felling trees, and you don't have a
    chainsaw around. You might not have even heard of a chainsaw, maybe. Instead, you look
    into your Schr√∂dinger's toolbox for the tool to down this overgrown shrub, and in two
    parallel universes you pull out an axe and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_who_say_Ni">herring</a>,
    respectively. In which universe do you to waste the most time?</p>
<p>I posit that the you holding the axe is going to still be whacking away at
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trees_%28poem%29">Kilmer's poem</a> when the other
    you starts to rip into grilled herring flesh after roasting it on the fire from the previously vertical woodpile.
    If you pull an axe out of your toolbox, and that's the only tool you know, you're likely roll up your sleeve
    and get to work chopping. On the other hand, the fish is so manifestly unsuitable for the job at hand,
    that there's approximately zero chance that it touches bark. Instead, you are likely to go search for
    what is really the right tool for the job, and are likely to end up using a chainsaw.</p>
<p>At this point, you are likely thinking: <i>"What does this have to do with me? I'm not chopping
    down a tree anytime soon, and even if I were, I've heard of a chainsaw."</i> The deal, though,
    is that we as individual developers and we as an industry keep attacking our problems with
    the axes in our toolboxes rather than searching out chainsaws.</p>
<p>The modern, portable, gas-powered chainsaw is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw#History">less than
    100 years old</a>. For thousands of years before that, an axe was the right tool for the job. Likewise,
    before cfengine, puppet, and the like, each server was a special snowflake and that's just how it was. Now,
    the best tool for the job of managing hundreds of servers is to treat them like cattle
    and use a configuration management system. Yes, it takes more set up time; it requires better discipline;
    and there are more moving parts that can break. But, it's the same with the chainsaw: you have to make sure
    it has gas; you'd better have more training and discipline, or I see a trip to the ER in your future;
    and a chainsaw can break down in all kinds of interesting ways, where an axe can... break a handle, I guess.</p>
<p>Lesson #1: even if you have the sharpest axe in the world, handed down across generations, still keep a lookout
    for the chainsaw that makes it obsolete. Lesson #2: when you find yourself fighting your tools, take a step
    back and see if you are dealing with an axe rather than a chainsaw.</p>
